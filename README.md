# Python_bootcamp
This is a bootcamp covering Python basics in six notebooks:

Session 1_1 for data types, operators, variables;

Session 1_2 for flow control (loops and branching) and user defined functions;

Session 1_3 for data structures (lists, tuples);

Session 1_4 for dictionaries;

Session 1_5 for numpy arrays;

Session 1_6 for a short introductory use case for Pandas dataframes.
